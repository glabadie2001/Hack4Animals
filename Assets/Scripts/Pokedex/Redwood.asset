  description: 'Scientific Name: Sequoia sempervirens

    Height: 200-300+ feet
    tall

    Weight: over one million pounds


    The Coast Redwood is the tallest
    tree species in the world. They grow in coastal areas in Northern California
    and Oregon where they take advantage of wintertime rain and year-round fog. These
    trees can live for thousands of years and historically may have been over 400
    feet tall. Mature redwoods are very resistant to wildfire. The primary threat
    to redwoods is logging and human development within their habitat, although they
    can also topple easily in bad weather due to shallow roots.'
