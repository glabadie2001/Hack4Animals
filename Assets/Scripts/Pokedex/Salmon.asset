  description: "Scientific Name: Oncorhynchus kisutch\nHeight: 24-30 inches long\nWeight:
    8-12 lbs\n\nCoho salmon change appearances at different points in their life\u2013young
    salmon have a special pattern that helps them to camouflage. Older salmon are
    gray with black spots on their back in the ocean but darken and develop red sides
    when going into freshwater to spawn. Coho salmon can be found all over the North
    Pacific Ocean and in streams and rivers connected to it. Although not as populous
    as they once were, coho salmon are not currently at risk due to overfishing.
